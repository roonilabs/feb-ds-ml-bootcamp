Title: Student Daily Study Habits and Academic Performance Dataset
1. Dataset Topic and Collection Method

This dataset was designed to explore the relationship between students’ daily study habits, lifestyle behaviors, and academic performance.
The data was manually collected through a short survey questionnaire distributed to students within my class and nearby study groups.

The questionnaire gathered the following information:

Age and gender

Average daily study hours

Average sleep duration per night

Daily time spent on social media

Class attendance percentage

Most recent exam score (used as the prediction target)

A total of 60 student responses were collected over three days.
Because the responses were first written manually and later entered into a spreadsheet, the dataset naturally contains minor errors, missing values, and inconsistencies, reflecting real-world data collection challenges.

2. Features (X) and Label (y)

In Machine Learning:

Features (X) are the input variables used for prediction.

Label (y) is the output variable we aim to predict.

Input Features (X)

Age – Student age in years (numeric)

Gender – Male or Female (categorical)

Study_Hours_Per_Day – Average daily study time (numeric)

Sleep_Hours – Average sleep duration per night (numeric)

Social_Media_Hours – Daily time spent on social media (numeric)

Attendance_Percentage – Percentage of attended classes (numeric)

Output Label (y)

Exam_Score – Most recent exam result out of 100 (numeric)

Objective:
To predict students’ exam scores based on their study habits and lifestyle characteristics.

3. Dataset Structure

Total Samples (Rows): 60 students

Total Variables (Columns): 7

6 input features

1 output label

Sample Dataset (First 10 Records)
Age	Gender	Study Hours	Sleep Hours	Social Media Hours	Attendance %	Exam Score
20	Male	3	6	4	75	65
22	Female	5	7	2	88	78
19	Male	2	5	5	60	55
21	Female	4	6	3	82	72
23	Male	6	7	1	90	85
20	Female	3	6	4	70	66
24	Male	5	8	2	92	88
22	Female	4	7	3	85	75
19	Male	1	5	6	55	50
21	Female	5	7	2	87	80
4. Data Quality Issues

Since the dataset was collected from real student responses, several realistic data quality challenges appeared:

Missing values: Some students did not report sleep hours or social media usage.

Typing errors: Certain attendance values were written as words (e.g., “eighty”) instead of numbers.

Outliers: One response indicated 12 study hours per day, which may be unrealistic.

Class imbalance: More male students responded than female students.

Inconsistent formats: Some exam scores were written as “75/100” instead of 75.

These imperfections make the dataset suitable for practicing data cleaning, preprocessing, and validation in real Machine Learning workflows.

5. Possible Machine Learning Applications

This dataset supports several Machine Learning tasks:

5.1 Regression

Predicting the numerical exam score using:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

5.2 Classification

Exam scores can be categorized into performance levels:

Fail: 0–49

Pass: 50–69

Good: 70–84

Excellent: 85–100

Applicable algorithms include:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Trees

5.3 Clustering

Students may be grouped based on behavioral similarity, such as:

High study time with low social media usage

Low sleep associated with low performance

Balanced lifestyle linked to high performance

K-Means clustering can reveal hidden behavioral patterns.

6. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the first critical stage of the Machine Learning pipeline: real-world data collection.
Unlike pre-existing datasets, this data was gathered directly from students, making it realistic, imperfect, and educationally valuable.

The dataset contains:

60 samples

7 variables

Missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers

It is well-suited for regression, classification, and clustering experiments.
Future steps will involve data cleaning, encoding, normalization, and model training, enabling meaningful prediction and analysis.

Overall, this assignment strengthens essential data science skills, including:

Data collection

Documentation

Data quality assessment

Preparation for Machine Learning modeling
