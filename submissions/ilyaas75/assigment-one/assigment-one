Practical Assignment: Data Foundations for Machine Learning
Title
Analysis of Factors Influencing Annual Salaries in the Technology Sector
1. Dataset Description and Collection Method

This study investigates salary patterns within the technology sector by analyzing how key job-related factors influence annual income levels.
The dataset was manually compiled by reviewing 54 active job postings from reputable professional platforms, including LinkedIn, Indeed, and selected local company career websites.

Each posting was examined individually, and relevant attributes—such as required experience, education level, work arrangement, company size, and listed salary—were systematically recorded in a spreadsheet.

To ensure consistency:

Salary ranges were converted to a single midpoint value.

Hourly wages were transformed into annual salaries using a full-time assumption of 40 hours per week and 52 weeks per year.

This dataset was created specifically for academic purposes and was not obtained from any pre-existing public dataset, ensuring originality and relevance to the assignment.

2. Features (X) and Target Label (y)

To support meaningful machine learning analysis, the following variables were collected.

Input Features (X)
Feature Name	Type	Description
Years of Experience	Numerical	Total years of relevant professional experience required
Education Level	Categorical	Highest degree required (High School, Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD)
Remote Status	Categorical	Work arrangement: Remote, Hybrid, or On-site
Company Size	Categorical	Organization scale: Small (<50), Medium (50–500), Large (500+)
Programming Skills Count	Numerical	Number of technical skills or technologies mentioned in the posting
Output Variable (Label y)

Annual Salary (USD) – Represents total yearly compensation.
When a salary range was provided, the midpoint value was recorded.

This structure makes the dataset highly suitable for supervised learning, particularly regression modeling.

3. Dataset Structure

Total Samples (Rows): 54

Total Variables (Columns): 6

5 input features

1 target label

Sample Data (First 5 Records)
Experience (Years)	Education	Remote	Company Size	Tech Count	Salary (USD)
3	Bachelor’s	Remote	Medium	4	85,000
0	Bachelor’s	On-site	Large	2	55,000
7	Master’s	Hybrid	Small	5	110,000
5	Unknown	Remote	Medium	3	95,000
10	PhD	Remote	Large	6	165,000
4. Data Quality Challenges (Real-World Characteristics)

Because the dataset was derived from real job advertisements, several practical data issues were observed:

Missing values: Around 15% of postings did not specify education requirements.

Formatting inconsistencies: Some salaries appeared as hourly wages and required annual conversion.

Salary ranges: Using midpoint estimates introduces approximation noise.

Textual variations and typos: Examples include “Bachlor” instead of “Bachelor’s”.

Subjective skill counting: The number of programming skills depends on how explicitly technologies are listed in the posting.

These imperfections accurately reflect real industry data and provide valuable material for data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering in later stages of the machine learning workflow.

5. Machine Learning Applications
Primary Task: Regression

Objective:
Predict the exact annual salary based on:

Experience level

Education requirement

Work arrangement

Company size

Technical skill demand

This supports algorithms such as:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Alternative Task: Classification

Salaries may be categorized into:

High Pay: Above $100,000

Standard Pay: $100,000 or below

This enables binary classification models useful for job market analysis and salary prediction tools.

Additional Analytical Opportunities

Feature importance analysis to determine the strongest salary predictors.

Comparison of remote vs. on-site compensation trends.

Exploratory data visualization for industry insights.

6. Conclusion

This assignment provided hands-on experience in collecting, structuring, and documenting a real-world dataset suitable for machine learning.
By manually extracting salary information from live technology job postings, the dataset captures authentic data challenges, including:

Missing information

Inconsistent formatting

Estimation uncertainty

In future stages, the dataset will undergo:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Categorical encoding and scaling

Model training and evaluation

This process will help bridge the gap between theoretical machine learning concepts and practical real-world data analysis, strengthening foundational data science skills.
